# Key Functionalities  

- **Data Retrieval:** Connect to the Google Scholar API to extract information about researchers and their publications.  
- **Data Processing:** Parse the JSON response and map the fields to the institution’s research database structure.  
- **Database Integration:** Store the retrieved data in the university’s research database, handling pagination and API errors.  
- **Automation & Reporting:** Update the information of the Top 3 researchers automatically, facilitating the generation of scientific production reports.  
- **Version Control & Documentation:** Manage the entire development process through GitHub with proper documentation and testing.
